## Purpose
The primary purpose of this application is to record mechanical repairs done on customers vehicles for my company Straight 6 Performance.

## Future
The future of this application will feature a landing page within the application with: the ability to search entries, create entries, create quotes / estimates, and upon searching entries - any entry / service with a valid email entered can be one-click delivered via email to customers. The search option will contain any references to invoices from parts stores (reciepts) and can search services by date, last name, or phone number. It will display ALL service tickets found by search.
